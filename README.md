The classic application of logistic regression model is binary classification. There can be other variants of logistic for handling multi-class classification problems, with related softmax regression logistic regression. These are kernel trick variants, but the standard logistic regression model is for the linear classifier. 

Neural networks can be compared to logistic regression. Logistic regression can be thought of as a one layer neural network.

In this code, logistic regression is implemented only with Numpy arrays. The code is https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/deep-learning-tutorial-for-beginners/notebook

The dataset is the sign language dataset ```Turkey Ankara AyrancÄ± Anadolu High School's Sign Language Digits Dataset``` that was made available here: 
https://github.com/ardamavi/Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset

The dataset contains sign language 100x100 JPG images using finger digits from 0-9. However, the dataset included here is the .npy compressed version of the data.
